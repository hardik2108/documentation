# ComfortSphere: Smart Home System

## Introduction
ComfortSphere is an advanced IoT-enabled smart home system designed to optimize indoor environmental conditions by integrating motion sensors, temperature and humidity control, and intelligent lighting adjustments. The system enhances user comfort, improves energy efficiency, and supports health-conscious indoor environments.

## Features
- **Automated Climate Control**: Uses the DHT22 sensor to regulate temperature and humidity.
- **Occupancy-Based Adjustments**: HC-SR501 PIR motion sensor detects room occupancy and optimizes climate and lighting settings.
- **Adaptive Lighting**: TSL2561 light sensor adjusts brightness based on ambient light conditions.
- **Smart Energy Efficiency**: Reduces unnecessary heating, cooling, and lighting usage in unoccupied spaces.
- **Remote Monitoring & Control**: Users can manage indoor conditions through a web application.
- **AI Integration**: Learns user preferences for customized climate settings.
